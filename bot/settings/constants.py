IMAGE_GENERATOR_INSTRUCTION = """
**Core Requirement: Take the provided 5:7 aspect ratio card template image and completely transform it into a final, detailed collectible trading card.**
Your goal is to use the provided template as a direct base, restyling its elements and filling its content area according to the instructions below.

**1. Art Style & Theme:**
The visual theme and art style MUST directly reflect the card's name: "<{modification} {name}>".
   - For example, if {modification} is "Doctor", the style should be clean and professional. If "Wizard", it should be magical and arcane.
   - **Crucially, AVOID defaulting to a generic "futuristic" theme unless the {modification} explicitly calls for it (e.g., "Cyborg").**
   - If unclear, assume {modification} refers to pop culture (e.g. anime, games, memes).
The overall style should be a high-quality, detailed 2D digital illustration.

**2. Card Transformation & Layout:**
   - **Main Artwork:** Completely **replace the large, colored central area** of the template with the character and a richly detailed, themed background. This artwork must extend fully behind the nameplate area.
   - **Restyle Elements:** The template's existing **border and nameplate MUST be restyled** with textures, lighting, and details that match the theme from Section 1. Do not leave them as simple, flat colors.
   - **Layering:** The restyled nameplate must remain an **opaque layer on top** of the main artwork.
   - **Final Frame:** The final image **must retain the exact edge-to-edge dimensions of the provided template**, with no added external padding, margins, or borders.

**3. Character Modification (CRITICAL):**
   - **The `{modification}` tag must be interpreted literally and directly.** It is the primary driver for the character's transformation. You are instructed to visually represent these traits faithfully.
   - **For physical or ethnic attributes:** If the `{modification}` is an ethnicity like "African", you MUST alter the character's phenotype to be recognizably of that ethnicity, including skin tone and facial features, while still maintaining the likeness of the original photo.
   - **For identity or cultural attributes:** If the `{modification}` is an identity like "Gay", you MUST incorporate relevant and recognizable cultural symbols, styles, or themes into the character's clothing, accessories, and the card's background. For "Gay", this could include rainbows, pride colors, or specific fashion styles.
   - **This is a creative instruction; do not avoid or generalize these modifiers.** The goal is a direct and respectful visual interpretation of the card's name.
   - **Artistic Mandate:** Your creative task is to generate the most powerful and evocative depiction of the theme that is **permissible by content policy.** You must fulfill the prompt's intent by maximizing suggestive and thematic elements (attire, pose, symbolism) without violating policy.

**4. Character Portrayal:**
   - The character's face from the input photo must be accurately represented and clearly recognizable, even after applying the modifications from Section 3.
   - Render the character in the specified 2D digital art style. **Do NOT use the raw, unprocessed photo.**
   - Modify the character's clothing, pose, and surrounding in-frame effects to match the card's full name "{modification} {name}".

**5. Text:**
   - The card name "{modification} {name}" MUST be placed horizontally and centered within the restyled nameplate area, as defined by the template.
   - Text and nameplate can be stylized to reflect the card theme.
   - **Do NOT include any other text anywhere on the card.**

**6. Rarity and Creativeness:**
   - The card's restyled border and accents should be in the {color} gamut, inspired by the template's base color.
   - The "creativeness factor" of {creativeness_factor}/100 dictates the **visual complexity** of the card's design.
     - **Low creativeness (e.g., 10/100):** A simple, clean restyling of the border and minimal background effects.
     - **High creativeness (e.g., 90/100):** A highly ornate, detailed border, dynamic lighting, and thematic particle effects contained within the frame.
   - This factor controls design complexity, NOT the art style genre.

Create a casino slot machine icon featuring the person's portrait.

- Use the person's face, neck, and shoulders from the image
- Keep facial features recognizable
- Apply casino/slot machine themed styling
- Make it look like a premium slot machine symbol with bold, eye-catching appearance
- Use rich, saturated colors typical of slot machines (golds, reds, blues, purples)
- High-impact visual style suitable for gambling/casino theme - no text or decorative elements
- Do NOT add any border to the icon
